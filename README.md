# additive
Calculate the limit of singuar value in numerically.

# Description
Calculate symmetric matrix A's singular value limit by given equation series.
We can calculate complicated operations as into one matrix operations with the value on this numerical calculations.
And for non symmertic matrix, make twice x twice larger matrix, we calculate another matrix on the matrix.
