Calculate the limit of singuar value in numerically.

# Description
Calculate symmetric matrix A's singular value limit by given equation series.
We can calculate complicated operations as into one matrix operations with the value on this numerical calculations.

We suppose: \[0,1\]x\[0,1\] region dx dy integrated input.
